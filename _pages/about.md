Hi, I am Lakshmi Rajagopalan. I am an software engineer for over three years. Working currently at Indix and EA prior to that.
Tamil and a native of Chennai.

Not much of a writer, and this is my first attempt at writing. So, please execuse me if my articles bore you out. 
Any feedback is much appreciated and I would work to improve on them.

My passion includes playing sports and reading. 
I do play dota almost everyday. Not much of a carry, but an excellent support. 
My steam handle is: **[404] athena**. More info on my games at [dotabuff](https://www.dotabuff.com/players/144760510).
Part of the 404-Team. Dont judge us as a 'Not Found'. We play everyday from 7pm to 9pm IST.
And on weekends, we have dota marathons starting on Friday Night with occasional breaks for sleep and food. 
You could find at all times some members of the team in a game.

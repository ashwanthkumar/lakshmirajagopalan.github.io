Hi, I am Lakshmi Rajagopalan. I am an software engineer for over three years. Working currently at Indix and EA prior to that.
Tamil and a native of Chennai.

Not much of a writer, and this is my first attempt at writing. So, please execuse me if my articles bore you out. 
Any feedback is much appreciated and I would work to improve on them.

My passion includes playing sports and reading. 
I do play dota almost everyday. Not much of a carry, but an excellent support. Part of the 404-Team.
My steam handle is: **[404] athena**. More info on my games at [dotabuff](https://www.dotabuff.com/players/144760510).
